# 💫 About Me

Hi, I’m **Atari John** ✨  
A software explorer who’s always tinkering with **Android apps, Kotlin, and system-level customizations**.  

I’m on a mission to build **reliable, high-performance applications**, whether it’s a sleek music player, a quirky brainrot experiment, or digging into device kernels to understand how things really work.  

🎵 Currently experimenting with **music apps** and **Jetpack Compose**, while dreaming about minimal, efficient systems that just… work.  

⚡ Fun fact: My **brainrot programming projects** might haunt you later 👻 – expect quirky features, over-engineered solutions, and the occasional “why did I even do this?” moment.  

🚀 When I’m not coding, I’m planning my **long-term Japan adventure** and exploring creative ways to merge **design, logic, and tech** into fun projects.  

I love **learning, experimenting, and sharing** what I discover along the way – and maybe leaving a little chaos behind in the process 😎.
